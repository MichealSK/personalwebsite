            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>
                Programming  is one  of my big passions,  which is why I chose to enroll  into<br>
                an Information Technology University in the first place.<br>
                Knowing me  as someone who has a deep  appreciation for the arts, people  were<br>
                initially confused as to why I did not instead take part of an arts university<br>
                instead.<br>
                <br>
                The answer? I think programming is an art in of itself, with more subtlety and <br>
                need for finer attention to detail and technical knowledge compared to any other<br>
                if you want it to be as optimal as possible.<br>
                Out of every other art, programming is what I want to work on professionally.<br>

            <h1>Visual Design, Writing and Music</h1>
            <p>
                I appreciate all forms of art: movie, sculpture, painting and drawing. I find <br>
                enjoyment in observing them and find fulfillment in spending my time indulging <br>
                in them and oftentimes analysing and giving constructive criticism to.<br>
                <br>
                The ones that I enjoy most though are the ones I am finding enjoyment in creating<br>
                myself: Visual Design, Writing and Music.<br>
                I am currently writing my own novel where a young detective is trying to solve a <br>
                series of supernatural murders and I sketch out my own concept character and <br>
                technology artwork for it.<br>
                <br>
                Using the knowledge I gained from my musical education as well as my own personal<br>
                research, I compose my own music: mostly neoclassical and techno pieces.<br>

            <h1>Videogame Design</h1>
            <p>
                There is one more art that I think has not been getting the appreciation it deserves,<br>
                or even the title I think it deserves: an art-form!<br>
                The only art-form that gets close to rivaling programming for me is videogame design.<br>
                <br>
                I have been using my programming knowledge to make mods for videogames for quite a while,<br>
                in fact, it is how I got into programming in the first place.<br>
                I have made videogame mods that have recieved recognition in their various communities <br>
                and have made a few amateur standalone videogames. I fully plan on continuing my passion<br>
                for videogame design in the future, especially when my programming knowledge deepens.<br>
